# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview 
During this challenge I was able to use my Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally,I summarized how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results
I conducted a statistical analysis of each city type and was able to create a data frame to effciently visualize important points shown below

### Total Rides:
Ubran cities have the highest number of total riders at 1,625. Rural cities have the least total riders at 125. Suburban cities have a total of 625 drivers which is in between Rural and Urban. These numbers are to be expected because urban cities typically have larger populations. This leads me to believe that my analysis is accurate.
### Total Drivers: 
Urban cities also have the highest number of drivers at 2,405 and Rural cities has the least at 78. Suburban cities are in between with 490 drivers.
### Total Fares:
Urban cities have the highest total fares at $39,854, Suburban in lower at $19,356, and Rural has the lowest total fares at $4,328. 
### Average Fare per ride:
The average fare per ride in Urban cities is $24.53 which is the lowest rate. Suburban average fare per ride is $30.97 while Rural cities average fare per ride is $34.62
### Average Fare per driver:
The average fare per driver in Urban cities is $16.57. Suburban average fare per driver is $39.50 and Rural average fare per driver is $55.49.

## Summary
Bases on my analysis I would advise Pyber to increase the drivers in rural cities. An incentive to increase drivers could be an additional $50 per day to increase drivers. The average fare per ride in rural cities is over $50 so 1 additional ride could balance out this incentive. Another great suggestion would be to decrease the drivers in urban cities. There are over 2,000 drivers in urban sities with only 1,625 riders per day. If Pyber could encourage some urban city drivers to ride share in rural areas that would balance out the demand. It would be interesting to know how ofter rural riders travel to urban or suburban areas. It is indicated that rural city riders travel for longer distances due to the increased average fare per ride. If rural riders are traveling to urban areas that would encourage urban drivers to start in rural areas with high probability that they would eventually get back to the urban areas due to the riders demands. I believe these recommendations would clear most disparities amongst the different city types.
